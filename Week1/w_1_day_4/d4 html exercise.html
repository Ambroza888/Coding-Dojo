      <h1>Java Script Basics</h1><br></br>
      <h3>JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different . JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server) , it can be to objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="">Variable Declaration </a>Javascript Variable are cointaners for storing data values -image a cup you fill with coffee,the cup holds the coffe,a variable holds a value.All JavaScript variables must be identifeied with unique names.These unique names are called identifiers,var x;
        </li>
        <li><a href="">Variable Assignments </a>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScripts variables - our cup can now have coffe poured in it,giving our variable a value to hold.The = assigment operator assigns a value to a variable.var x=10;
        </li>

        <li><a href="">Data Types </a> Data types are an important concept;to be able to oparate on variables you need to know the data type.There are six data types that are Javascript primitives:Boolean - true or false;null - null aka nothing;Number 42 or 3,.13132;String "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array - bla bla bla;</li>

        <li><a href="">Conditionals </a>When you write code, you want ot perfom diffrent actions for diffrent dicisions - hitting diffrent code blocks based on values or condinlans that have beem ,et. You can use codnitinal statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditions is falese.</li>

        <li><a href="">Loops </a> There are many diffrent kinds of loops in every programming language but they all esentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times.Imagine you have to run a mile,well you run around the track four tiems and then you stop.Thas a loop!</li>

        <li><a href="">Functions </a>Functions are an encaspaulation of a code block.When we call our funcition this will run that code block.Think of it as a list of functiosn.As an examples imagine we are putting togheter a desk from Ikea,we open up the instructionas and get started,first we screw the legs to the top next we plat he table the right way up.Done!We finishied our instrucitosn.Sadly there a a ton more tables to do so lets our our function over and ove and over again</li>
